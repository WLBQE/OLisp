To build our compiler, first make sure that opam package 'llvm' is installed,
and the OCaml version is at least 3.12. Then, in the project root path, type:
  make

To run our test suite, first make sure that commands 'clang' and 'llc' are
properly linked. Then, in the project root path, type:
  ./test_all.sh

Test results will be printed to stdout, and any test failure will be logged in
'test_all.log'
