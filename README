To build our compiler, first make sure that opam package 'llvm' is installed,
and the OCaml version is at least 3.12. Then, in the project root path, type:
  make

To run our test suite, first make sure that commands 'clang' and 'llc' are
properly linked. Then, in the project root path, type:
  ./test_all.sh

Test results will be printed to stdout, and any test failure will be logged in
'test_all.log'


10 test programs

8. fail_add.olisp (negative)
In OLisp, built-in lambda '+' (i.e. add operator) can only be applied to two or
more arguments of the same type (either int or double). In this program, '+' is
applied to an integer and a double, which leads to a sematic error "double and
int do not match".

9. fail_call.olisp (negative)
In this program, lambda expression 'foo' takes an integer and returns an
integer. But 'foo' is then applied to a double, which leads to a semantic error
"double and int do not match".

10. fail_define.olisp (negative)
In OLisp, an global identifier can only be bound once. In this program, the
identifier 'a' is bound twice, which leads to a semantic error "identifier a is
already declared".
